        Hello, my name is Alex, and the game I am going to review today is Fate
        Grand Order. It is a single player game. It is fairly simple; players
        can beat the full game with any character. Battles are turn-based, with
        the difficulty increasing as the story progresses. The mechanics are
        easy to learn, as there are only 3 attack types per character.
      </p>

      <p>
        The User Interface for this game is pleasant and fit in with the game’s
        theme and story. Players can customize how the text appears in game. The
        controls are easy. There are no cheats. The game is set in a high-tech
        environment, and the graphics match the mood, with holograms of the
        planet’s surface on the main menu’s background. The art style is an
        anime art style, although most characters have a different illustrator.

        The music is great and matches the mood. Due to a recent Unity Engine
        Update, the game has gotten faster, and it runs better on Android
        phones. Depictions of violence are kept PG. The story is the main focus
        of the game, and it is skippable. It is set in 2018, on the Chaldea
        Security Organisation, which was set to protect humanity. The main
        character must time travel into the past in order to prevent the end of
        Humanity, while fighing alongside historical heroes. Each era has a
        destabilizing factor, the Holy Grail. Story chapters expand the world,
        and the player visits locations such as Joan of Arc’s France, Nero’s
        Rome, 1800’s London, and Gilgamesh’s city of Uruk. One progresses
        through the story like a visual novel, with dialogue and cutscenes and
        multiple choices. The game has extra quests such as “Interludes” and
        “Rank-Up Quests” which revisit locations, they serve to power up allies
        and to build their character.

        The main character is customizable, the player may swap their gender and
        clothing, with each set of clothes providing different skills. Heroes
        and villains have varied backgrounds, and may be customised as well, and
        while most of them are European, there are several from other countries
        such as Qin Shi Huang of China (Chinese Emperor), or Karna from India
        (epic hero from the Mahabharata). The game gets biweekly updates and is
        replayable.

        Fate Grand order is a Mobile Gacha Game, which means it makes money off
        of micro transactions akin to gambling. A Player may spend money on
        currency named Saint Quartz and use it to revive themselves during
        gameplay or to summon new servants, this currency can also be obtained
        for free while playing the game.

      <p>
        In conclusion, while Fate Grand Order is a time-consuming game that
        requires farming and possibly money, however, the story is extremely
        good, and the characters are interesting. While I do not recommend
        spending money on this game, except during festivity time, I do
        recommend everyone to play and enjoy the aspects of this game I have
        been loving for the past year. The game teaches interesting aspects
        about heroes and legends, such as the legend of Gilgamesh, and his
        friendship with the monster of the forest Enkidu.
